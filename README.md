## About The Project :blue_book:

I decided to create my first ever 2D engine game for fun. I'm listening to a video series on YouTube made by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI) to learn the basics of 2D games development. I'm heavily inspiring myself with the game Stardew Valley to make my 2D game. The character I'm using is Linus from the game. My goal is to learn more about game development in general and have fun doing it.
